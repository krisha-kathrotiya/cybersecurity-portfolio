# Cybersecurity Portfolio

Welcome to my Cybersecurity Portfolio! This repository contains a collection of projects that I've worked on as part of my personal learning journey in cybersecurity. These projects cover a wide range of topics, including:

Security Audits: I've done security audits on different systems and applications, identifying potential vulnerabilities and suggesting ways to improve security.

Risk Assessment: I’ve worked on evaluating the security risks of various systems, helping me understand how to mitigate potential threats and strengthen security defenses.

Incident Documentation: This includes the process of documenting security incidents — from identifying a breach to reporting and containing the incident, helping me understand incident response and recovery.

Technical Exercises: I’ve carried out various hands-on exercises using tools like Linux, SQL, and other cybersecurity tools to simulate attacks and test defenses.

This portfolio is a reflection of my commitment to growing my skills and learning more about cybersecurity by applying theoretical concepts to real-world problems. Each project I’ve worked on demonstrates my ability to use industry-standard tools and frameworks for security analysis, risk management, and incident handling.

Feel free to check out the following sections:

00-professional-statement: A personal statement about my career goals and what drives me to pursue a career in cybersecurity.

01-security-audit: This section highlights the security audits I’ve done, where I’ve used my knowledge to analyze systems, identify risks, and recommend security improvements.

I’m continuously working to build and update this portfolio, and it’s helping me gain a stronger foundation for a future career in cybersecurity.
