# Professional Statement

I am a computer science student developing practical cybersecurity and IT risk skills through hands-on coursework and structured portfolio projects.

I am currently completing the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate, where I am learning how to identify security risks, assess controls, and document findings clearly using industry-recognized frameworks such as the NIST Cybersecurity Framework.

My interests include cybersecurity governance, IT risk management, and threat awareness in business environments. Through this portfolio, I am documenting my learning progress, including security audits, incident documentation, and technical exercises involving Linux and SQL.

My goal is to secure a cybersecurity internship where I can support a security or IT risk team through strong documentation, analysis, and a continuous learning mindset.
